            <h2>Present: Student</h2>
            <p> I am Jojo, 35 year old, a mother to a 2 year old daughter, from Wellington</p>

            <p>I was in the banking industry for more than 8 years. I have a strong passion for lending and love helping people get into their first home or looking at purchasing their first investment property
              </p>
              
            <p>Last month in August 2021, I just resigned my corporate job and joined a coding bootcamp at Dev Academy.Coding was always something I wanted to learn but there was never enough time, motivation or resources. So when the opportunity presented itself, I took it with both hands </p>
              
              <p>I have ideas around developing lending apps and platforms for the banking industry, which can make it easier for lenders to assess credit applications, while meeting compliance and credit policy requirements. I look forward to working with my "coding friends", learning and growing. I hope to find a job as a junior developer when I complete the course </p>
