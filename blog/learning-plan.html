<h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway? </h2>
web/ app developer for lenders/ banking industry

<h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h2>
<p>I can study and focus for a long period of time i.e 4 hours straight without break. 
I really enjoy what I am study/ doing because I can be creative and having fun exploring testing trying new things continuously
Limitation is trying to study and look after my 2 year old at the same time is very challenging. With level 2, my sister-in-law now can look after her 3 days a week, she goes to daycare 2 days a week from 10am to 4pm. 
This allow me 4 hours to do my study during the day (2 hour for grocery shopping/ cooking/ house work). 
Then I study again after my daughter asleeps from 10pm to 2am.  
So if everything goes as plan ill have 8 hours per day for study. </p>

<h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? </h2>
<p>Working as a team is not always easy. 
I think that the soft skills of communication ie. expressing my self clearly, add valuable contribution and active listening and have an open mind is something that I continue to work on. 
Time management is key as well. I am not very good at time management. Working on it continuously </p>

<h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</h2>
<p>I checkout slack often to make sure Im up to date. Ask when stuck and learning from others thru slack.  Catching up with my facilitator everyweek to ensure Im on track. </p>

<h2>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h2>
<p>ask for help, stop and reflect to figure out what can I do differently to achieve my goals. Communication is key </p>

<h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way </h2>
<p>Slack/ my facilitator./ youtube/ google
</p>

<h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>
Review of my work/ assignment and provide feed back as to how can I do it differently/ better. 
I am open to constructive feedback</p>

<h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. 
It’s important to plan these in</h2>
<p>As above</p>

<p>These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list. You should put them together in the way that you feel they are most clearly communicated.
You and your facilitator will discuss your learning plan in the next check-in.* </p>
