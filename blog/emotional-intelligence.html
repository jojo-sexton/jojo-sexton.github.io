<h2 > What is Emotional Intelligence (EI) </h2>
</p>
<p align="justify"> Emotional Strength was first introduced by Abraham Maslow in the 1950s. The first published use of the term 'EQ' (Emotional Quotient) is an article by Keith Beasley in 1987.
Later, the motional intelligence has been defined, by Peter Salovey and John Mayer, as "the ability to monitor one's own and other people's emotions, to discriminate between different emotions and label them appropriately, and to use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior".  

<h2>EQ v.s  IQ Debate </h2>
<p>IQ: is ability and EQ: is an essential skill sets to optimize the ability. </p>
<p>A metaphore for IQ vs. EQ is Book Smart vs. Street Smart. </p>
<p>In the 1995 best-selling book Emotional Intelligence, written by science journalist Daniel Goleman, he defined EI as the array of skills and characteristics that drive leadership performance.
Here are a few examples to demonstrate the difference between EI and IQ:</p>
<ul>
<li>Achievement drive and standards: EQ</li>
<li>Influence:EQ</li>
<li>Conceptual Thinking: IQ</li>
<li>Analytical Ability: IQ</li>
<li>Initiative: EQ</li>
<li>Self-Confidence: EQ</li>
</ul>

<h2 > How emotional intelligence skills is helpful for my learning journey and employability?  </h2>
<p align="justify">
  Today experts recognize that IQ is not the only determinant of life success. Instead, it is part of a complex array of influences—one that includes emotional intelligence. Many companies now mandate emotional intelligence training and use EQ tests as part of the hiring process</p>
