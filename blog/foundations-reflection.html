            What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?  What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?
          </h3>
            <p>1. I put too much pressure on yourself without realizing it. With self awareness and having empathy, I learned that it's ok to be not ok. I am studying full time and being a Mum is challenging. I've learned to have empathy for myself and learn not to judge myself. 
            2. I often compare myself with others who are more experienced than me. 
            with mindfulness practice it helps to train the mind to be calm and stable and shift my focus away from negative thoughts. 
            3. I love what I do and I won't give up. Perserverance is my value and my strength. There is a lot of new things to learn and other aspect of life demanding my attention. I just keep going , sleeping 4 hours of sleep everyday and hope to get things done in a timely manner.

            What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Core learning is very helpful. I enjoy the human skills or the meta of learning is introduced slowly each week as the content of the curriculum changes. Core learning improves productivity and helps with problem solving as well as develop growth mindset
          </p>
          <h3>
            What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The most challenging aspects of the core learning is that the content is very rich and deep. For me, I will need a longer time to actually understand and be able to practice what i've learned in core learning. 
          </p>
          
          <h3>
            Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I think that EDA spend so much time focusing on core learning because it cares about its students. EDA treats the students as human who need important skills in life such as taking care of ourselves, taking care of people, empathy, listening, effective confrontation, how to give and receiving feedback. At the end of the day, we will be more confident in ourselves. Human skills is not only helpful in working enviroment but also in our daily lives. So EDA not only teach us how to code but also how to be successful. Thank you!
          </p>
          
          <h3>
            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
          </h3>  
          <p>
            I can't speak highly enough of the core learning as this is life skills. However, with the time constraint in both foundation and bootcamp, I do hope that we can simplify the content of core learning in foundation or extending the term of the course for a couple of weeks so that we feel a bit more in control of handling both tech and core learning
